[![CMakeBuilds](https://github.com/chfhhd/raylibstarter/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chfhhd/raylibstarter/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

A simple Space Invaders clone - not a full game - to demonstrate some object-oriented techniques in C++ using the raylib library.

Note also the [project wiki](https://github.com/chfhhd/simpleinvaders/wiki): There you will find a detailed tutorial for this project.

This project uses code from the window scale letterbox example [1] contributed by 
Anata (@anatagawa) and reviewed by Ramon Santamaria (@raysan5) and the CMakeLists.txt 
example provided in the Raylib source code [2].
